= Generate Library Tests

Run only in these circumstances:

1. A major version bump, backwards compatibility is not a concern.
2. A minor version bump, only _**AFTER**_ running the existing tests against the
   regenerated code.
3. A patch version bump,  only _**AFTER**_ running the existing tests against
   the regenerated code and only if it is necessary to add a minor tweak to
   check for regressions.
